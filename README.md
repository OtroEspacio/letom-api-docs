## Letom API Docs

This is the documentation for Letom API powered by [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate).

## Getting Set Up

Initialize and start Slate. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:

```shell
# either run this to run locally
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
$ vagrant up
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!

Now that Slate is all set up on your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).
